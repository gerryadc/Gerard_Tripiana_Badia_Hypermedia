                <h2 class="section-header">Summary</h2>
                <p>I began my professional career with AEK Athens in 2005. At AEK, I established myself as a solid defender before making the leap to the Italian Serie A with Genoa in 2008. In Italy, I continued to develop my defensive skills.</p>
				<p>My time with AC Milan in 2010-2011 was an enriching experience. I then joined Werder Bremen in the German Bundesliga, where I gained valuable experience in German football during the 2011-2013 seasons.</p>
				<p>However, it was at Borussia Dortmund where I experienced some of the highlights of my career. During my time in Dortmund (2013-2018), I became a respected defender and participated in high-level competitions, including the UEFA Champions League.</p>
				<p>My next chapter took me to the English Premier League with Arsenal, where I continued to showcase my skills as a central defender during the 2018-2021 seasons.</p>
				<p>Finally, in 2021, I decided to return to my home country and join Olympiacos, where I continue my professional career as a defender. Throughout my career, I have had the honor of representing the Greek national team and various clubs in some of Europe's most competitive leagues. My experience and defensive abilities have allowed me to remain a respected footballer throughout the continent..</p>

                <p>I have a strong interest in joining Real Betis Balompié to further my professional football career. I am particularly drawn to this club because of its rich history, strong team spirit, and dedication to developing young talent.</p>
    
				<p>Real Betis has a fantastic fan base, and I believe playing for this club would be an incredible experience. I am motivated to contribute to the success of the team and help achieve its goals. Additionally, I'm eager to embrace the culture and heritage of the Real Betis community both on and off the pitch.</p>
